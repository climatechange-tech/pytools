This repository contains modules that, on one hand, were used in the generation
of the climatic indicator information in several projects, such as SIS-INFRA, ARCH (Saving Cultural Heritage),
LIFE (test sites of Bilbao and Zarautz) and SESA (Smart Energy Solutions for Africa).
On the other hand, higher level modules were created, developed and improved
during the course of the projects, so that eliminates the need of surfing among the codes, trying to remember
complex or sintactically difficult procedures.
This repository has been uploaded from the originally created at GitHub.
For the sake of practicity, simplicity and organisation, modules have been classified
according to the main purpose that envolves the corresponding modules.
It is not expected to add, remove or rename any of these folders in the short run.
At the moment not every module has a help docstring.
This is an ongoing process which will develop quite slowly.
